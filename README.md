# Flashcard application

The purpose of this application is to support people in their procedure of learning a new language, specifically in terms of vocabulary acquisition. Learning a set of words quickly is a huge task, mainly if you live in a country with a different language and don't have money to pay for a course. Then, flashcards come as a powerful tool to decorate them and increase your knowledge of that language, reducing the time to achieve your goals.

> Technologies used: Node.js, JavaScript, ReactJs, css and mongoDB.

# Features available

* Register decks, words, and users. The words can be registered by youtube video id (The words said in the video will be catch and selected by you) or added one by one.
* Log in: The user can have many decks. Each deck stores cards that contain words and their translations.

* When you access a deck, you are going to be able to see, hear, change the word rate and review the unlearned words how many times you wish.

OBS: I made a very similar application in another project but for this one, I'm using 'ReactJS' and implementing new features. The gif above does not correspond to the design as I'm dedicating more time to make the app visually pleasing.
